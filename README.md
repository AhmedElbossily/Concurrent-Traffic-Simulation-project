# Program a Concurrent Traffic Simulation

<img src="data/traffic_simulation.gif"/>

The purpose of this project is to simulate traffic in a city with vehicles. Vehicles drive around randomly and change the direction at each intersection. Each object in the city grid will run independently in its own thread.
In this project, a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol was built between vehicles and intersections to complete the simulation using mutexes, locks, and message queues.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 2.8
